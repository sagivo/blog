I love writing about software engineering, leadership and anything in between.  
The blog is meant to be a practical guide for real-life situations.  
Currently I'm building a new company - [LiblLab](https://liblab.com).  
I enjoy enabling people to build amazing products.  
Before that I managed the AWS SDK teams. And before that, I worked at and helped billion people to connect by sharing moments of their lives. Before Facebook, I started 3 companies across the US, Israel and Brazil.

In my free time, I love taking long walks while listening to audiobooks (follow me on [GoodReads](http://goodreads.com/sagivo)). I’m also into Jiu-Jitsu and I consider myself lucky if I don’t get hurt once a month.

Fun fact - I’m a private pilot so if you ever need a ride just let me know! You will need to provide the airplane though ✈️

GLHF :)
